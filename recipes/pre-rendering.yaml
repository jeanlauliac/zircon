  Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and
  **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML
  for a page.

  - **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at
    **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
  - **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the
    HTML on **each request**.

  Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for
  each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation
  for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
